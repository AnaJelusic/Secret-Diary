This is a web app made with Bootstrap. There is a signup form, which can be changed to login form by clicking on a link below. Each form has its validation which checks if he user has written correct information and if the user already exists.
Username and password (hashed) are being saved to the database with cookie. User can check if they want to stay logged in.
When the user logs in, they are transferred to another page where they can write whatever they want and the input is automatically saved in the database via ajax. If the user already has input saved, it will be shown after the login.

This is a project for The Complete Web Decvelopment course on Udemy.
